  <meta name="citation_abstract" content="The introduction of Smart Electric Vehicles (SEVs) represents an increasingly disruption on automotive area, once integrates advanced computer and communication technologies to highly electrical cars, which come with high performances, environment friendly and user friendly characteristics . But the increasing complexity of SEVs prompted by greater dependence on interconnected systems, autonomous capabilities and electrification, presents new challenges in cybersecurity as well as functional safety. The safety and reliability of such vehicles is paramount, as unsafe or unreliable operation in either case represents an unacceptable risk in terms of the performance of the vehicle and safety of the passenger.">
